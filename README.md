Its advised yu install it globally

### Difficulties and Findings

I was not able to implement the image feature due time limitations
I could have also split the routes to seperate files but for the purposes of the task i figured this would not be neccesary
The sample demo is quite basic and is responsive tested on opera and chrome smartphone simulators
